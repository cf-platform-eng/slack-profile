# slack-profile

A slack app that will be used to munge slack profiles so they show up specific ways in our partner channels. For now "certain ways" means with the users' company names appended to their profile names.

## todo
Slack workspaces can be set up to use display or "full names" for members. Partner is set to use full names. Consider changing back to "display name:" makes more sense that we can edit that instead of messing with users' real names.
